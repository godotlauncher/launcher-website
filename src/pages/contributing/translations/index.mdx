# How to Contribute Translations

Godot Launcher 1.5.0 introduced internationalisation with 14 locales ready to use. That’s a big step, and it only works long-term if people like you keep the wording natural and accurate. Whether you just spotted an odd phrase or you’re ready to bring an entirely new language online, here’s how you can help.

## Start with what’s already shipped

- **Try the launcher in your language.** Switch to your locale in `Settings → Appearance → Language` and note any phrases that feel off.
- **Share quick fixes.** Small corrections are perfect for a GitHub issue or a Discord message if you don’t have time for a full pull request.
- **Track what’s covered.** The current release includes System auto-detect plus English, Italiano, Português, Português (Brasil), 简体中文, 繁體中文, Deutsch, Français, Español, Polski, Русский, 日本語, Türkçe, and Malti.

If you just want to report a typo, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues/new/choose) or drop a note in the [community hub](/community/). We’ll make sure it gets reviewed.

## Ready to contribute directly?

1. **Read the translation contribution checklist.** It walks through the JSON structure, validation tests, and review process: 
    - on the Docs page [https://docs.godotlauncher.org/contributing/translations/](https://docs.godotlauncher.org/contributing/translations/), or
    - on GitHub [https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md)
2. **Fork the main repo.** The localisation files live under `src/locales/` and are grouped by namespace (projects, installs, settings, and so on).
3. **Keep the keys, translate the values.** The tests check that interpolation tokens and markup stay intact, so translate only the human-readable parts.
4. **Run the tests.** `npm test:unit` validates that there are no errors, nothing is missing, and all placeholders line up.
5. **Open your pull request.** Mention the language you touched and anything reviewers should pay extra attention to.

We seed new locales with AI to save time, so your human input is what makes the experience truly feel native.

## Need a walkthrough or partner?

- Coordinate with other translators or reviewers on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Ju9jkFJGvz).
- Visit the main [Contribute page](/contribute/) for broader project roles if you want to help beyond language work.
- Not sure how technical you need to be? The checklist includes detailed steps, so you can follow along even if you’re new to GitHub.

Thanks for helping make Godot Launcher accessible to more people. Every string you polish helps a creative team feel right at home.
