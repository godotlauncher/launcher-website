# Godot Launcher 1.3.0

Godot Launcher v1.3.0 is out. This release focuses on small but impactful quality-of-life improvements to help keep your project list clean and your experience smooth.

<!-- truncate -->

## ðŸ†• Whatâ€™s New

- **Duplicate Project Name Detection**  
  Adding a project with the same name as an existing one now triggers an error. This helps avoid accidental overwrites and keeps your project list tidy.  
  [[PR#13]](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/pull/13)

- **Project Sorting**  
  You can now sort your project list. Whether you have two projects or twenty, this makes it easier to find what you need, faster.  
  [[PR#11]](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/pull/11)

- **Lucide Icons Refactor (Partial)**  
  Weâ€™ve updated most icons across the app to use the Lucide set for a more consistent look. Some pop-up menus still use system defaults for now.  
  [[PR#10]](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/pull/10)
