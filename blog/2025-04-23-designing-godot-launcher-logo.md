# Designing the Godot Launcher Logo: Blending Identity with the Godot Engine

Hey everyone, Paulskii here üëã  
I'm one of the volunteers on the **Godot Launcher** project, and I had the chance to design the logo for it. Just wanted to share a bit of the process and how it came together.

<!-- truncate -->

## What I Wanted the Logo to Be

I had three goals when starting this:

1. It had to look good and stand on its own.
2. It needed to feel like it belonged next to the **Godot Engine**.
3. It had to be fun, but still feel professional.

When I thought about the word ‚Äúlauncher,‚Äù a rocket was the first thing that came to mind. It‚Äôs a symbol pretty much everyone understands ‚Äî something launching, taking off. It made a lot of sense for a **game engine launcher**, so I used that as the base idea.

## Connecting It Back to Godot

Since this is the **Godot Launcher**, I really wanted the logo to connect back to the **Godot Engine** somehow. I looked at the Godot logo (the one by Andrea Calabr√≥) and thought ‚Äî what if I could build a little rocket using those same kinds of shapes?

I played around with some vector work and started sketching a tiny rocket that could almost feel like a cousin to the Godot logo. Something you could imagine sitting right next to it in your taskbar and not looking out of place.

## Building the Final Design

I used Adobe Illustrator for everything ‚Äî from the rocket to the color palettes and layout ideas.

For colors, I went with a strong orange base to contrast the classic Godot blue. I figured most people will have both icons (Godot and the launcher) side by side, so I wanted them to stand out from each other while still feeling related.

For the font, I picked **Nunito Sans Bold**. It‚Äôs got a friendly and round vibe that‚Äôs really close to the one Godot uses, so it felt like a good fit.

The first draft of the logo was a bit thinner, and it didn‚Äôt work great when scaled down. So for the second draft, I made the rocket bolder, tweaked some proportions, and added wings and a little exhaust flame to give it some movement and personality.

I worked closely with **Mario Debono**, who created the **Godot Launcher** itself. He was super supportive of the direction, and we bounced around a few small tweaks before landing on the final version you see today.

## Why This Meant a Lot to Me

Working on the **Godot Launcher logo** was a really fun challenge ‚Äî and a personal one too.

I'm super into **game UI and UX design**. There's something I really love about making interfaces feel smooth, simple, and satisfying to use ‚Äî especially for tools and systems where clean design really matters. I‚Äôve been working in motion graphics and product design for a while, but my goal has always been to bring those skills into **game development**.

UI/UX in games isn‚Äôt just about menus. It‚Äôs about the feel of a tool, the feedback a player gets, the little things that make a dev‚Äôs workflow smoother. That kind of invisible polish is what I care about most.

If you‚Äôre working on a game or tool and need someone to help with **UI/UX design**, I‚Äôd love to be part of it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it's for players, devs, or somewhere in between ‚Äî I just enjoy making good stuff easier and nicer to use.

Thanks for reading, and hope you like how the logo turned out!  
Until next time ‚Äî later!
