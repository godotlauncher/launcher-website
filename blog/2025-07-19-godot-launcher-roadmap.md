## Why a roadmap?

Godot Launcher has grown a lot lately. We're seeing more users downloading it, using it for their daily work, and giving feedback. It felt like the right time to open up what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes.

The new **public roadmap** lets you (and anyone curious) check:

- What we're actively working on
- What's coming soon
- What we're considering for later
- What we‚Äôve already shipped

It‚Äôs hosted directly on [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/orgs/godotlauncher/projects/1) so it stays close to where the work happens.

---

## What the roadmap includes

We‚Äôve organized it into **four clear stages**:

- **Backlog** ‚Äî ideas that we‚Äôre considering
- **Working On** ‚Äî things currently being built or tested
- **Next** ‚Äî coming up soon, already planned
- **Done** ‚Äî Merged into main, not yet shipped
- **Shipped** ‚Äî features already released and live

Each card gives a short description, and some are linked to related issues or discussions.

> üí° You can comment, vote, or submit your own suggestions too [here](https://github.com/godotlauncher/launcher/issues).

We‚Äôd love to hear:

- Have you shipped anything with it?
- Are you building tools, prototypes, or full games?
- How are you using Godot Launcher day to day?
- What‚Äôs missing or slowing you down?
- What would make your workflow easier?

The more we understand your day-to-day work, the better the launcher can become. Whether you're just getting started or building production-ready games, your feedback matters.
