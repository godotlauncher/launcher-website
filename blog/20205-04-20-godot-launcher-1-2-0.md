## Godot Launcher 1.2.0 is Out! ðŸŽ‰

You can now choose to launch each Godot project in **windowed mode or not**, independently.

<!-- truncate -->

This new per-project setting is useful for multi-monitor setups or window management preferences. From Godot 4.4 onward, the editor also remembers window size and position â€” so you can set it once and forget it.
