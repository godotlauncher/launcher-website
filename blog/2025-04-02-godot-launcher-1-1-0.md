## Godot Launcher 1.1.0 is out! ðŸŽ‰

This release introduces a small but helpful quality-of-life feature for developers using Visual Studio Code. When creating a new Godot project with the `Setup Visual Studio Code as Text Editor` setting enabled, the launcher now automatically configures VSCode to hide Godotâ€™s autogenerated `.gd.uid` files by <!-- truncate --> including the following in `settings.json`:

```json
"files.exclude": {
    "**/*.gd.uid": true // Exclude Godot's autogenerated UID files
}
```

These `.gd.uid` files were introduced in [Godot 4.4](https://godotengine.org/article/uid-changes-coming-to-godot-4-4/) as part of a new system to improve script tracking. While theyâ€™re useful for the engine, they usually donâ€™t need to be visible while coding.

This small tweak keeps your workspace clean and focused on the code that matters.

Download the latest version from [godotlauncher.org](https://godotlauncher.org/download/).
